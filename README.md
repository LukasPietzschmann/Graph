# Graph
This is an implementation of multiple Graph Algorithms in Java.

It implements:
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Minimal-Spanning-Tree Prim-Algorithm
* Detection for strongly connected Components (SCC)
* Bellman and Fords and Dijkstras Algorithm for finding the shortest Path between two nodes (SP)
